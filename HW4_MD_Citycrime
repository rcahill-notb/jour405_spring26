In this assignment, we will be working with a dataset of total crimes reported by Maryland cities for two consecutive years. You'll load the data, calculate the violent and property crime rates for each city for both years, and then calculate the percentage change in the crime rates between the two years. You'll also write a short story based on your findings.

### Task 1: Load the Tidyverse and Janitor

You will need to load the tidyverse library and the janitor library

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
install.packages("janitor")
library(janitor)
```

Then you'll load the data from the web. The URL for the data is: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_cities_crime_2019_2020.csv. You will create a dataframe called `md_cities` that contains the data from this URL.

### Task 2: Load the Data

```{r}
md_cities <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_cities_crime_2019_2020.csv") |> clean_names()
```
### Task 3: Calculating Rates

Calculate violent and property crime rates for each city for both years using `mutate()`. You'll create four new columns: `violent_rate_2019`, `property_rate_2019`, `violent_rate_2020`, and `property_rate_2020`. You'll need to figure out the proper unit rate, given that there are varying populations. There's no perfect choice; choose the one that works best for you. Save the results to a new dataframe called `md_cities_rates`.

```{r}
md_cities_rates <- md_cities |>mutate(violent_rate_2019= (violent2019/pop2019)*100)
md_cities_rates <- md_cities_rates |>mutate(property_rate_2019= (property2019/pop2019)*100)
md_cities_rates <- md_cities_rates |>mutate(violent_rate_2020= (violent2020/pop2020)*100)
md_cities_rates <- md_cities_rates |>mutate(property_rate_2020= (property2020/pop2020)*100)

```

### Task 4: Describe the Rates

Examine the new dataframe, `md_cities_rates`, by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio and sorting by the rate columns. Write a couple of sentences about the results, comparing and contrasting the cities with the highest rates (both violent and property) in 2019 and 2020. Do you see any patterns? What does this tell you about crime in Maryland cities? What's the story here?

ANSWER HERE

Many municipalities had zero violent crime in 2019 or in 2020. Most of these have very small populations (a few thousand at most, and sometimes only several hundred), and many are in wealthy Montgomery County. The largest of these communities are Chevy Chase (Montgomery County) and Manchester (Carroll County)

In 2019, only four municipalities had a violent crime rate of more than one per capita. Baltimore City led this list, with a crime rate of around 1.8 per capita, followed by Ocean City (Worcester), Williamsport (Washington) and Elkton (Cecil). In 2020, that list expanded to six. This time, Ocean City topped the list with a violent crime rate of over 2.4 per capita, followed by Baltimore City, Cambridge (Dorchester), Princess Anne (Somerset), Kitzmiller (Garrett) and Williamsport. 

There are a number of municipalities that experienced no property crime, in 2019 or in 2020. These are mostly small, rural communities with fewer than 1,000 people. In 2019, Ocean City had the highest rate of property crime at around 10.3 per capita. The other municipalities with crime rates above 5 per capita were Oakland (Garrett), Elkton (Cecil), Hyattsville (Prince George's), Cambridge (Dorchester), Princess Anne (Somerset) and Queenstown (Queen Anne's). Ocean City once again led the way in 2020, and it wasn't even close--the property crime rate of 12.1 per capita was more than twice that of the second-place city. Colmar Manor and Landover Hills (both in Prince George's) and Oakland rounded out the top four. It is noteworthy that the only two communities with rates above 5% in both years are Oakland (home of Deep Creek Lake) and Ocean City. Both have a lot of seasonal homes owned by rich people, who may not be there for much of the year, and I suspect this makes them a target for theft.


### Task 5: Calculate Percentage Change

Let's add two percentage change columns to your dataframe: one for violent crime rates and one for property crime rates. You'll calculate the percentage change between 2019 and 2020 for each city. Save the results to a new dataframe called `md_cities_change`.

```{r}
md_cities_change <- md_cities_rates |> mutate(violent_percent_change = (violent_rate_2020-violent_rate_2019)/violent_rate_2019*100)
md_cities_change <- md_cities_change |> mutate(property_percent_change = (property_rate_2020-property_rate_2019)/property_rate_2019*100)
```

### Task 7: Describe Percentage Changes

Look at the `md_cities_change` dataframe by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio. Write a couple of sentences describing the percentage change results. What's more interesting here, the patterns or the outliers? What's the story in the data?

Some municipalities which had no violent or property crime in 2019, but did have crime in 2020, are listed as having an infinite increase. This is not very interesting, and neither are the huge percentage changes in communities with very small populations (where even a small, random numerical variation makes a big difference in the percentage swings). What is interesting are the changes in Maryland's three largest incorporated cities. Frederick saw a huge drop in crime between 2019 and 2020, with property crime down 90% and violent crime down 95%. Baltimore City saw smaller but still significant decreases of 26% and 13% respectively. However, in Gaithersburg, property crime rose by 16.6%, while violent crime rose by 52%.

### Task 8: Tell the Best Story

Write up a lede and nutgraf of a story with the _best_ story idea you've found in this assignment. The lede should be a single sentence that summarizes the most important information in the data. The nutgraf should be a paragraph that provides more context and explains why the data is important.

ANSWER HERE

Crime rates plummeted in Frederick in 2020, with violent and property crime decreasing by over 90% compared to 2019--a huge result for Maryland's second-largest city.

This stands in stark contrast to the numbers from Maryland's third-largest city, Gaithersburg, where violent crime rose by over 50% in 2020, and property crime saw a smaller but still notable 16% increase. This increase in violent crime is the largest of any city with more than 20,000 people in Maryland.




### Task 9: Save Your Work and Put it on GitHub

Save this notebook, then commit it to your local repository. Push the changes to your GitHub repository and submit the URL for this file in ELMS.



### Task 10: 

Using the 2020 violent crime rate, calculate the percentiles using `ntile()`. Save the results to a new dataframe called `md_cities_percentiles`. How many cities are above the 90th percentile?
```{r}
md_cities_percentiles <- md_cities_rates |> mutate(percentile = ntile(violent_rate_2020, 100))
```
Calculate the Interquartile Range of the 2020 violent crime rate using `summarize()` and R's `IQR()` function. The syntax is similar to how `mean()`
works.
```{r}
md_cities_rates |> summarise(IQR(violent_rate_2020))
```

Do the results change your best story idea from the previous assignment? Why or why not?

No, I'm still more interested in what's going on with crime in Frederick and Gaithersburg. The changes are so large for just one year, and that's really significant for cities of that size.
