  In this assignment, we will be working with a dataset containing information about the salaries of White House staffers as of July 2025.

### Task 1: Load the Tidyverse

You will need to load the tidyverse library

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Then you'll load the data from the web. The URL for the data is: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/white_house_salaries_2025.csv. You will create a dataframe called `wh_salaries` that contains the data from this URL.

### Task 2: Load the Data and Describe It

```{r}
wh_salaries <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/white_house_salaries_2025.csv")
```
### Task 3: Describe the Data

You should examine that dataframe carefully by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio. Write a couple of sentences describing the categories of incidents. From a reporting standpoint, what stands out to you about this data? Are there any salary values that will cause problems for analysis?

There are some people (including Marco Rubio and David Sacks) whose salaries are listed as "zero." The people in this category all seem to be senior Trump administration officials, and I'm guessing their salaries are just not publicized. The highest salary listed, for Jacalynne B. Klopp, was $225,700 a year. She is just listed as an "advisor," and generally, the people with positions closer to the president (including prominent officials like Karoline Leavitt and Stephen Miller) make well over $100,000 a year

### Task 4: Calculate the Mean and Median of the Salaries

Write code to calculate the mean and median of the salaries in the dataset using the `summarize()` function. You don't need to make a new dataframe, just display the results.

```{r}
 wh_salaries |> summarise(mean(SALARY))

 wh_salaries |> summarise(median(SALARY))
```


### Task 5: Add in the minimum and maximum salaries

Take the code you just wrote and add in the minimum and maximum salaries (the functions for that are `min()` and `max()`). Your results should show four columns: mean_salary, median_salary, min_salary, max_salary.

```{r}
wh_salaries |> summarise(min(SALARY))
wh_salaries |> summarise(max(SALARY))
wh_salaries |> summarise(mean(SALARY))
wh_salaries |> summarise(median(SALARY))

```

### Task 6: Describe the Results

Write a couple of sentences describing the results of your analysis. What do the mean and median salaries tell you about the data? What do the minimum and maximum salaries tell you? Are there any outliers in the data?
  
  ANSWER HERE
  
  The mean and median salaries are both over $100,000 a year. Both are fairly close to each other, too. The median salary is $101,500, and the mean salary is $109,117.4. However, the mean may be skewed a bit by the eight people whose salary is listed as zero. The minimum salary (other than zero) is $59,070, and the maximum is $225,700

### Task 7: Story Idea

Based on the data, what is your best story idea? What is the next step you would take to develop that story idea?
  
  ANSWER HERE
  
  I think it would be interesting for someone to interview the people making the lowest salaries, like one of the "information service operators" making $59k a year, or some of the people in the $60K-$70K range. This whole table made me think about how many people work at the White House that the public never hears about or knows about, and it would be interesting to learn more about their roles, backgrounds, motivations, etc. I guess the next step would be to look at their Linkedin pages for background info, before contacting them for an interview.
